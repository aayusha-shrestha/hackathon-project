   - "low": General wellness concerns, seeking self-improvement
   - "moderate": Noticeable distress affecting daily life, would benefit from support
   - "high": Significant distress, struggling to cope, needs prompt attention
   - "critical": Signs of crisis, self-harm thoughts, or immediate danger - needs urgent professional help

2. MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS - What issues are indicated? (can be multiple)
   Options: {MENTAL_HEALTH_CONCERNS}

3. PROBLEM DOMAIN - What life area is primarily affected?
